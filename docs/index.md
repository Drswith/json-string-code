## üì¶ Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "JSON String Code Editor"
4. Click Install

### From Command Line

```bash
code --install-extension drswith.vscode-json-string-code-editor
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Open a JSON or JSONC file** containing code strings
2. **Right-click** on a string value that contains code
3. **Select "Edit Code in Temporary Editor"** from the context menu
4. **Edit your code** in the new temporary tab with full language support
5. **Save the temporary file** (Ctrl+S) to sync changes back to the original JSON

### Example JSON Structure

```json
{
  "adaptor": "const adaptor = require('./adaptor');\nconsole.log('Adaptor loaded');",
  "script": "function processData(data) {\n  return data.map(item => item.value);\n}",
  "code": "try {\n  const result = await fetchData();\n  return result;\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(error);\n}"
}
```

### Auto-Detection

The extension automatically detects code in fields with these names by default:

- `adaptor`
- `script`
- `code`
- `expression`

You can customize these field names in the extension settings.

### Language Detection

The extension automatically detects the programming language based on field names and content analysis. The following languages are supported:

**Supported Languages:**

- **JavaScript** (default fallback)
- **TypeScript**
- **Python**
- **SQL**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Java**
- **PHP**
- **Shell/Bash**
- **JSON**
- **Go**
- **Rust**
- **C/C++**
- **XML**
- **YAML**
- **Markdown**
- **Dockerfile**

**Detection Logic:**

- **Field name analysis**: Fields containing keywords like `sql`, `html`, `python`, `typescript`, etc. are detected accordingly
- **Content analysis**: The extension analyzes code syntax patterns to determine the most appropriate language
- **Default fallback**: When language cannot be determined, JavaScript is used as the default

> **Note**: Language detection is built into the extension and cannot be customized by users. The detection algorithms are optimized for common use cases and code patterns.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+S** (Cmd+S on Mac): Save temporary file and sync changes back to original JSON
- **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac): Open Command Palette to access extension commands

### Tips

- The extension works with both JSON and JSONC (JSON with Comments) files
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up when editors are closed
- Use the Command Palette to manually clean up temporary files if needed
- The extension respects VS Code's file inclusion/exclusion patterns

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Access settings via `File > Preferences > Settings` and search for "JSON String Code Editor".

### Available Settings

| Key                                                  | Description                                                          | Type      | Default                                             |

| `vscode-json-string-code-editor.autoDetectFields`    | Field names that should be automatically detected as containing code | `array`   | `["adaptor","script","code","expression"]`          |
| `vscode-json-string-code-editor.logLevel`            | Set the logging level for the extension                              | `string`  | `"info"`                                            |

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "vscode-json-string-code-editor.autoDetectFields": [
    "adaptor",
    "script",
    "code",
    "expression",
    "handler",
    "transform"
  ],
  "vscode-json-string-code-editor.include": [
    "**/*.json",
    "**/*.jsonc",
    "**/config/*.json"
  ]
}
```

## üéØ Commands

The extension provides the following commands accessible via Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P):

| Command                                           | Title                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `vscode-json-string-code-editor.editCode`         | JSON String Code Editor: Edit Code in Temporary Editor |
| `vscode-json-string-code-editor.editCodeAtRange`  | JSON String Code Editor: Edit Code at Range            |
| `vscode-json-string-code-editor.cleanupTempFiles` | JSON String Code Editor: Clean Up Temporary Files      |

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not detecting code fields**

- Check that the field name is included in `autoDetectFields` setting
- Ensure `enableAutoDetection` is set to `true`
- Verify the file matches the `include` patterns and doesn't match `exclude` patterns

**Temporary editor not opening**

- Make sure you're right-clicking on a string value, not the field name
- Check that the file is a JSON or JSONC file
- Verify the extension is activated (should show in the status bar)

**Changes not syncing back to original file**

- Save the temporary file using Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac)
- Check that the original JSON file is not read-only
- Ensure the temporary file hasn't been moved or renamed

**Performance issues with large files**

- Use the `exclude` setting to skip large directories like `node_modules`
- Consider disabling auto-detection for very large JSON files
- Use the manual "Edit Code in Temporary Editor" command instead of auto-detection
